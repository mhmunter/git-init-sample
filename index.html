    <p>   My Father has been the Manager of Alamo Music Center for the last thirty Five years. 
      My Brother Runs his own recording studio, and runs sound at special events. I have a background 
      in art and music, but I also have a B.S in History. For the last few years I have been working 
      in the banking industry. Now I am looking to upgrade my skills, and combine my artistic side, with 
      my practical side.
